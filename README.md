# Steps to run the project locally 

1 - First we will clone the project

2 - Once we have the project in our computer we have to run "npm i" and "npm start"

3 - This should be it.

# Run the test coverage

1 - Go inside our project on the command line

2 - Run "npm run coverage"

3 - It will generate a "coverage" folder where inside it will be a index.html file that we can open and we will be able to see the coverage too.
